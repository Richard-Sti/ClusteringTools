# ClusteringTools

This repository contains Python tools for analyzing clustering of galaxies and haloes, with a particular emphasis on the kNN (k-nearest neighbours) and 2PCF (2-point correlation function) calculations.

## Overview

1. **kNN-CDF Calculation**: A module that provides tools to calculate the 1-dimensional kNN-CDF statistic.
2. **2PCF Calculation**: A module to calculate the 2PCF from 3D pair counts.
3. **Random Point Generation**: Tools to generate random points in various geometric configurations, including within a sphere, within a box, and on the surface of a sphere.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - numpy
   - scipy
   - Corrfunc

2. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Richard-Sti/ClusteringTools
   cd ClusteringTools
   ```
